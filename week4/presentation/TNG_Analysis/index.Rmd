## Star Trek the Next Generation
```{r, echo=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(TNG)
load("TNGsummarized.Rda")
#load("../TNG Analysis/TNGsummarized.Rda")
```
* Off the air for > 20 years
* Continues to have huge impact on our culture & technology
* Many (main) characters that influenced the series

## Show statistics

```{r, echo=FALSE}
numEpisodes <- length(unique(TNG$episode))
numCharacters <- length(unique(TNG$who))
numDialogs <- length(TNG$who[TNG$type=='speech'])
numMainDialogs <- sum(resultset$numSections)
perc <- round(numMainDialogs / numDialogs * 100)
```


The show had `r numEpisodes` episodes, `r numCharacters` different characters and a total of `r numDialogs` script dialogs.
These I consider the main characters that have a calculatable impact on the show ratings

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mainCharacters
```

They account for  `r numMainDialogs` script dialogs, which is `r perc`% of all dialogs.

The show ratings have a fairly high average
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(numData$imdbRating)
```

## Exploration

```{r, echo=FALSE}
importanceOrder <- order(-rfMod$importance[,1])
topImportantVariables <- rownames(rfMod$importance)[importanceOrder][1:5]
rsq <- round(max(rfMod$rsq),3)
mse <- round(min(rfMod$mse),3)
```

To analyze who's lines, words or sections (of dialog) have the most impact on predicting the imdbRating, a dataset was created that combined all maincharacters and their lines, words ans sections as features for the imdbRating.
Resulting in a matrix of 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
dim(numData)
```

After training `r rfMod$ntree` Random Forests. The predictor on the dataset endend up with $R^2$ of `r rsq` and a MSE of `r mse`
Which seems not great, but it probably overfitted the data, so it did a pretty good job predicting the actual ratings

These were the top 5 most important variables for predicting the imdbRating

```{r, echo=FALSE}
topImportantVariables
```

## Conclusion

Based on these conclusions it's hard to say which character has a positive or negative impact on the ratings. First of all a dataset with `r numEpisodes` samples is hard to train on. 
Other factors were also excluded, like the category of episode (Disaster/Monster of the week, Humanist message, Political Message, Character piece, etc, etc.) or other cateories  like (time travel, Borg, Klingon, Holodeck, etc)

But that should't deter you to play around with the data [https://tomlous.shinyapps.io/TNG_Analysis/](https://tomlous.shinyapps.io/TNG_Analysis/)

Live long and prosper!
